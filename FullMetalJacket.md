Movie: Full Metal Jacket

Review: Full Metal Jacket follows a group of aspiring young men as they endure the trials of basic training in their quest to become Marines and, ultimately,
soldiers in the Vietnam War. The film is amazing but very dark at the same time. It can be difficult for some people to watch; I highly recommend everyone
to watch this film because of how interesting it is.
